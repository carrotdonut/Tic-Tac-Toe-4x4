# Tic-Tac-Toe-4x4

Mario-Themed 4x4 Tic Tac Toe made with Java!

Created for my final project for Grade 11 Computer Science. I worked with my partner Amy Zhou.
We used Java Swing and the java.awt.event package to create the GUI and handle click events.

# Starting the Program:
Start the program with "OpenScreen.java", which displays an opening screen for the game. 
You can then click whether you want to play 1-Player or 2-Player, and the main game will then open.

# NOTE: This project was completed in March, 2016. I am just uploading the code files now.
